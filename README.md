# Preamble
	This is a tool I built to quickly generate CRD Timecards.  It should
	be distributed as a single zip archive including a copy of the GPL v3
	License, this readme, a blank template.xlsx and a tc-gen.jar file.

# Usage
	To start generating timecards first you need a template file to point
	this program towards.  A blank template sheet is provided in the 
	archive you downloaded
